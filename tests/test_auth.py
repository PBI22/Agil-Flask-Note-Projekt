"""
This module contains tests for the authentication functionality of a Flask application. 
It includes tests for login success and failure scenarios, signup process, and logout functionality.

Functions:
- test_login_success(client): Tests successful login with valid credentials.
- test_login_fail(client): Tests login failure with invalid credentials.
- test_login_wrong_pass(client): Tests login failure with a correct username but incorrect password.
- test_signup(client, dbsession): Tests the signup process and verifies that the new user 
  is added to the database.
- test_logout(client): Tests the logout process, ensuring the user is properly logged out.

Each function simulates HTTP requests to the respective authentication endpoints 
and asserts the expected outcomes based on the response status codes and response data content.

def test_login_success(client):
    """
    Test the login functionality with valid credentials.

    Parameters:
    - client: The Flask test client.

    Returns:
    - None

    Raises:
    - AssertionError: If any of the assertions fail.

    Description:
    This function sends a POST request to the '/auth/login' endpoint with valid username and password.
    It then checks the response status code, the presence of 'Hjem' in the response data, 
    and the presence of 'Logged in as:' and 'Logout' in the decoded response data. 
    It also checks that the response data does not contain the string 'Invalid username or password'.
    If any of the assertions fail, an AssertionError is raised.

    Description:
    This function tests the logout functionality of the application. 
    It first logs in the user by sending a POST request to the '/auth/login'

    and 'Logout' in the response data.

    After logging in, the function sends a GET request to the '/auth/logout' 
    endpoint to log out the user. It checks if the logout was successful by verifying
    the response status code and the presence of 'You have been logged out' in the
    response data. It also checks that 'Logged in as:' is not present in the response data.
